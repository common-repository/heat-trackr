This plugin allows the user to display heatmaps, clickmaps, scattermaps and scrollmaps plus perform A/B split testing.

== Description ==

The heat-trackr plugin allows the user to display the following:

* heatmaps (a heatmap is a graphical representation of data using colors to indicate the level of activity).

* clickmaps (a clickmap shows where users have clicked on a page and the count).

* scattermaps (a scattermap shows where individual clicks have been made by users on a page).

* scrollmaps (a scrollmap shows how far down a page the visitors have made it).

Additionally the user can also configure and measure A/B style split testing.
